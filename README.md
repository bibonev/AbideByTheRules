# AbideByTheRules
Project which helps children to develop the skills of moving on the road safely. 
This project has been developed in 2011/2012, when I (B. Bonev) was at the age of 14.
The project has been used in some Bulgarian schools in "Hour of the Teacher". 
If interested, feel free to contact me.
